# Stock_Market_Analysis

## Information

My challenge is to create a stock market analysis using GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units) to build deep-learning forecasting models for predicting the stock prices of Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft. I could load real-time data using Yahoo Finance and compare that with the GRU-predicted model using RNN (Recurrent Neural Network). I then compiled and trained the
model and recorded the mean-squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared to measure the model's accuracy. After evaluating the model I compared the predicted vs actual stock
market pricing and wrote a user interface where you can input the year and company and it will be able to tell you the price of the stock of that given year. __Remainder: Only select years between 2010 and the current year__. I then deployed the stock market analysis deep learning forecasting to Streamlit Cloud for users to see.
